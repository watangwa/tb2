## Hello Tory Burch (AEM) Devs,
This package contains all of project javascript being used on the Tory Burch (AEM) project.

Our project javascript is broken up into "PJS modules". Each module is defined in it's own file, and the module files are concatenated together to produce the final project javascript snippet which gets uploaded to Optimizely.

The PJS modules may include more modern [ECMAScript 2015](https://babeljs.io/learn-es2015/) code. We use Babel to compile the code into ES5 compatible code before uploading to Optimizely.

We also wrap each module in a try/catch and IIFE block to isolate each module's code from one another and to manage/log potential breakages.

The project.js file contains special comments which describe the module that will be added to the finished compiled code.

Example module:
```
/**
 * PJS Module
 * @module pjs-module
 */
```

This comment would be replaced with the contents of the "pjs-module" file during the compilation process.

We are happy to answer whatever questions you might have regarding any of this.
